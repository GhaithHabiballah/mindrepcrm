Here’s what I want for in basic

Master lead tab

Lead outreach tabs 

Like email, sms, etc

Temp lead tab 

That’s all but the function is what’s important 

Master lead tab and all outreach lead tabs should be 2 way. Wtv is changed on master will change on outreach tab and vice versa.

Temp lead tab is let’s say today I find 50 leads I’ll paste it there 

Click check duplicates button and it will tell me if any of the temp leads are already in the master remove them and tell me what it removed.

That way each day I’ll just paste the leads I find in temp and make sure we didn’t reach out to them already before I reach out 

Temp tab won’t have any persistent history. I will add leads. Check for duplicates. Then delete the leads from temp 

It will always be empty 


Important functions 

Button to check duplicates between temp and master 

Button to add a new lead info. For example I wanna start collecting sites too now with all the info we collect already like name and phone email etc.  

I just click that button to instead a new lead info 

And the point is that it will now be added to all pages like master, email sms, instagram 

And the math should work in the sense that if I add on email tab that new info will also show on master tab Important that they filling section are menus like we have for EcomLinked. It’s a menu and I select email or sms or wtv and not type it. Only thing that should be typed is personal info like name phone number etc  make all the prompt for claude code to achieve this
